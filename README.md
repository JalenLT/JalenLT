I’m a full-stack developer working as an IT Analyst/Programmer, always tinkering with new tech and building things that (hopefully) make people’s lives a little easier.

Right now, I’m diving into Python and leveling up my cloud skills with AWS certifications. Most of my day-to-day is spent in JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Laravel, and React. If it’s web development or AI, I’m probably interested!

## What I’m Building

Check out [Story Builder](https://github.com/JalenLT/StoryBuilder)—it’s my passion project and the one I’m most proud of (even though it’s still a work in progress). I’m pushing myself to make it as polished and professional as possible.

I recently got pretty deep into AI and web dev together, which led me to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system using Laravel, JS, Milvus, and Gemini. That’s been a fun (and challenging) journey!

Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefan-seunarine-199618201/). Always happy to meet fellow devs, chat about tech, or brainstorm ideas.
