# Hi, I'm Stefan

**Full-stack Developer | Laravel · React · TypeScript**

I’m a full-stack developer who enjoys learning new technologies and building tools that make people’s lives a little easier.  
Most of my work involves **JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Laravel, and React**, and lately I’ve been spending more time with **Python** and **cloud development using AWS**.

## What I’m Working On

### [Story Builder](https://github.com/JalenLT/StoryBuilder)
A graph-based story creation platform built with Laravel, Inertia, React Flow, and TypeScript. It’s my main passion project and a long-term effort to design something professional, maintainable, and enjoyable to use.

### [Personal Portfolio](https://github.com/JalenLT/portfolio)
This project is an intuitive, geometric, nature-inspired portfolio that utilizes parallax and organic motion to communicate my skill and experience as a developer.
