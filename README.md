# Hi, I'm Stefan

**Full-stack Developer | IT Analyst/Programmer | Laravel · React · TypeScript**

I’m a full-stack developer and IT Analyst/Programmer who enjoys learning new technologies and building tools that make people’s lives a little easier.  
Most of my work involves **JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Laravel, and React**, and lately I’ve been spending more time with **Python** and **cloud development using AWS**.

## What I’m Working On

### [Story Builder](https://github.com/JalenLT/StoryBuilder)
A graph-based story creation platform built with Laravel, Inertia, React Flow, and TypeScript. It’s my main passion project and a long-term effort to design something professional, maintainable, and enjoyable to use.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation System
I’ve also been exploring AI integration within web apps, building a RAG system using **Laravel, JavaScript, Milvus, and Gemini**. It’s been a rewarding deep dive into combining backend logic, embeddings, and modern AI models.

## Currently
- Learning Python more deeply and building small projects to practice  
- Preparing for the **AWS Developer Associate** certification  
- Refining developer experience and code quality across my repositories  
- Researching how AI assistants can be integrated into Laravel systems
